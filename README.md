Welcome to my learning project! This app is designed to enhance my knowledge of key technologies including Java Expression Parser (JEP), Material Design, and Lottie Animations. The goal is to implement a rich user interface and effective computational features to build something both beautiful and functional.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Java Expression Parser (JEP)**: Evaluate complex mathematical expressions and formulas seamlessly within the app.
- **Material Design**: Fully responsive UI/UX adhering to Google's Material Design principles, ensuring a smooth, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing user experience.
- **Lottie Animations**: Integrated beautiful, lightweight animations using the Lottie Library to enrich user interactions.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- **JEP (Java Expression Parser)**: For parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.
- **Material Design Components**: To create a modern and cohesive UI that enhances user experience.
- **Lottie for Android**: High-quality animations that are lightweight and easy to implement.
- **Kotlin**: Primary language used for app development.
- **Jetpack Compose**: UI toolkit for building the app's interface declaratively (if used, otherwise mention XML layout).
